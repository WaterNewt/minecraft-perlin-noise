# Perlin Noise Terrain Generation

A demo of how Minecraft uses Perlin Noises for their world generation. This demo only uses Continentalness, which in Minecraft terrain generation is one of the many features that determine terrain shaping. This demo uses a basic implementation of Continentalness (or atleast compared to Minecraft terrain shaping). In this demo, the Continentalness directly affects the height of each block.
